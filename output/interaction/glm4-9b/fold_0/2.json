It then initializes a dictionary `relations` to store the extracted relations. For each relation type in `relations`, it constructs a regular expression pattern to match that relation type in the sentence. It then uses `re.findall` to find all matches of this pattern in the sentence. For each match, it checks if it is in the list of requirements. If it is, it adds a tuple of the match and the first shared phenomena to the corresponding list in `relations`. Finally, it returns `relations`.\n\nThe test case at the end of the script demonstrates how to use this function. It prints the result of calling `extract_relations` on the given sentence and entities. The output is a dictionary with the same structure as `relations`, but with the actual extracted relations."
